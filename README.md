### My work & motivation

- I want to make things better in tangible, measurable, predictable ways. The best way to
  motivate me is to show or tell me how it will help someone or something.
- My favorite category of work is medium-to-large tasks that require some creativity, some
  research, and force me to learn something. I like to be able to sit down and work on a task
  for hours without stopping to troubleshoot tools or platforms. I also like complex debugging;
  tracking down and fixing something that seems like it should be impossible is very satisfying
  to me.
- I have no problem changing direction, even drastically, when there’s a good reason for it. I
  am frustrated by constant pivots if and only if they don’t seem well-reasoned. I consciously
  avoid the sunk cost fallacy and am content to throw away even a large body of work if
  there’s a better way to do things.
- I have a scope creep refactor problem; I like to leave things better than I found them, and I
  can get too wrapped up in fixing existing problems that delay the real task at hand. This also
  happens when I see just one more thing that I could do so quickly. One thing leads to another
  and soon enough, I’ve spent a whole day fixing one more thing.
- My time estimation is absolute trash. It’s my worst technical skill by far. I say “hope to have
  that done today” a ton, and I mean it when I say it, but I often am not thinking of the whole
  picture. I’m working on getting better but it’s slow going. If you need an accurate estimate,
  tell me and I’ll make sure I’m considering the whole picture.
